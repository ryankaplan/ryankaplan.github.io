[Oster, GÃ©rald, et al. "Real time group editors without operational transformation."](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00071240/)

This paper describes a method of building online collaborative systems that is far simpler than OT. A few years ago I
 would have dismissed it as a hack (a key to its implementation strategy is that it never deletes characters from
 the document). But a few years of experience in software engineering have taught me to appreciate it's simplicity in
  implementation. Simple implementation and "good enough" feature set is sometimes the right move.

 It's pretty easy reading as far as academic papers go. It's full of examples to make sure that you really know
 the edge cases of the algorithm by the time you're done reading.

Below is a gif of my own (toy) implementation. The code is on Github [here](https://github.com/ryankaplan/woot-collaborative-editor).
