	I found <a href="http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/10/">an article by Chris Wellons</a> describing a Game of Life simulation that runs on the GPU and I wanted to try it myself. I wrote my version of it in <a href="http://skew-lang.org/">Skew</a> (which turned out to be a pleasure to use) and it works pretty well. On my laptop it runs fine with grids of 16 million cells.
